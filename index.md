# ABOUT ME

A graduate student majoring in information management with 1+ years as a cybersecurity researcher. As a self- learner craving information knowledge, with an active learning attitude, my greatest interest is to absorb the domain knowledge and tempt to implement it. I worked as a research assistant on three research projects related to ESG assessment automation, served as a teacher assistant for two full-English-taught courses, and completed a one-year internship during my master's degree. Besides, as an interdisciplinary learner, I show adaptability, flexibility, and communication capability based on my previous abroad experience which led me to win first place in an Information retrieval competition, NTCIR, in Tokyo in 2022.
